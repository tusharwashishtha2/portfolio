                <p class="hero-intro">I am a Python developer with a strong foundation in AI, machine learning, and modern web development. My academic background in Information Technology is supported by practical experience in developing real-world, end-to-end solutions.

I have built and deployed machine learning applications using Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit, and Flask—delivering both deep learning models (for audio, image, and text data) and practical web interfaces. My projects include an award-winning bird species identifier (combining neural networks for sound and image) and a full-stack text-to-image generation platform leveraging Stable Diffusion XL.

I am skilled at translating data science and AI models into user-friendly applications by integrating cloud tools (Kaggle, Colab), public-facing dashboards, and high-quality user experiences with HTML and CSS. My work style is hands-on, research-driven, and focused on building scalable, reliable systems ready for real user feedback.

Eager to join a dynamic, collaborative team, I am looking to grow further as a developer—especially in roles that combine Python, AI, and innovative frontend technologies..</p>
